          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>My name is Rickard, I am 24 years old and live with my partner and dog in Kumla. I am a positive and happy person who is driven to face challenges.
            <br/>
                At the moment I am studying at EC Utbildningar in the course Microsoft .Net Developer - Cloud Computing, I graduate in May 2017. Beside the studies I have two jobs, one as a personal trainer on the Strength family and the other is as a software developer at the IT Master. I have previously worked as a painter in Orebro and felt after 6 years it was time for a career change.
            <br/>
                During my training, I have independently taken hold of learning more than .Net has to offer. My goal is to become a developer as versatile as possible.</p>
